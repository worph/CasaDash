// SyncRoutes reconciles the app's generated Caddy routes — the ones publishing it
// on the deployment's additional domains (Settings › Domains) — into its
// docker-compose.override.yml, and returns the compose files to bring the stack up
// with.
//
// It runs before *every* up, which is what makes the routes self-healing: adding a
// domain, removing one, reinstalling an app, restoring a backup or hand-editing
// the override all converge on the same file the next time the stack comes up. A
// domain change only reaches a running container through a recreate anyway, so
// there is no cheaper moment to do this.
//
// The returned file list matters: the override may not have existed before this
// call (an app with no user edits is generated one from nothing), or may have been
// emptied out by removing the last domain, and `docker compose` has to be handed
// exactly the files that now exist.
