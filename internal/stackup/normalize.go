// Normalize reconciles an app's base compose and .env with the deployment as it is
// right now, and runs before every up.
//
// An app is installed against one deployment and started against whatever the
// deployment has since become: a new app network, a new data root, a new domain or
// public IP. Nothing about that invalidates the app's own config, so nothing about
// it should stop the app from starting. Normalize is what makes that true:
//
//   - the base compose is put back through envinject.Transform, so its data-root
//     binds and its external network are ${DATA_ROOT} / ${APP_NET} references
//     rather than whatever those happened to resolve to at install time;
//   - the deployment's .env.app is ensured into the app's own .env, so the same up
//     run by hand from the app's folder resolves those references identically.
//
// Both are idempotent, and both are best-effort: a compose we cannot parse is the
// operator's to fix, and failing the up over it would strand the app with no way
// back — so we carry on with what is on disk and let `docker compose` report.
