// with no marker is treated as booting for the first time (a legitimately slow
// event for apps that seed a database or run migrations on first run), so the
// page reassures rather than warns and waits far longer before hinting at
// trouble. See internal/server/launch.go.
//
// The signal is advisory — it never gates anything — so it is stored as a plain
// empty file per app id under CasaDash's own state dir, and every failure here
// is swallowed: a missing or unreadable marker just means "treat as first boot",
// which is the safe direction.
