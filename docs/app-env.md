# `.env.app` — what an app receives

CasaOS keeps the variables it needs to run and the variables it hands to the apps it
manages in **one environment**. You cannot tell, looking at a CasaOS container's env,
which half is which — and the two drift into each other.

CasaDash separates them:

| | Lives in | Owned by | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What CasaDash needs to run** | CasaDash's own environment (`docker-compose.yml`) | CasaDash | `DATA_ROOT`, `APPSTORE_URL`, `PROTECTED_APPS`, `CASADASH_ADDR` |
| **What an app receives** | `.env.app` | the **deployment** | `APP_NET`, `APP_DOMAIN`, `APP_PUBLIC_IP_DASH`, `APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` |

Nothing is in both, so there is never a question of which one wins.

## The file

```
${DATA_ROOT}/AppData/casadash/.env.app
```

`AppData/casadash/` is CasaDash's own app directory — the same folder a deployment
installs the dashboard's compose stack into, and where CasaDash keeps its settings and
store cache. Everything CasaDash owns is in that one place, with no hidden sibling.

It is a plain `KEY=VALUE` file, and it belongs to the **deployment**, not to CasaDash:
on a Yundera PCS the orchestrator writes it at provisioning; on a plain install it is
the operator's to edit. CasaDash creates it once, with a documented default, and
**never overwrites it** — an upgrade that silently reverted the deployment's domain,
network and credentials would be a bad day.

An empty value means *the deployment does not have this*, and the key is skipped
rather than written blank: an app is better off with an unresolved `${APP_DOMAIN}` —
which `docker compose` reports — than a blank one, which silently routes it at
nothing.

## How it reaches an app

On install, and again on **every start**, CasaDash reads `.env.app` and ensures each
key in the app's own `.env`:

- a key already there is **set** to the current value, in the line it already occupies;
- a key that is missing is **appended**;
- **everything else is left alone** — a variable the operator added to an app's `.env`
  is theirs, and survives.

Keys are ensured one at a time, so neither file's ordering matters.

Merged in alongside are the few variables CasaDash computes per app and per install,
which a deployment cannot state: `AppID`, `PUID`, `PGID`, `TZ`, `DATA_ROOT`,
`DATA_HOST_PATH`. Setting those in `.env.app` has no effect.

## Why it is re-applied on every start

Because an app is installed against one deployment and started against whatever that
deployment has since **become** — a new app network, a new data root, a new domain,
a new public IP. None of that invalidates the app's own configuration, so none of it
should stop the app from starting.

This is why an app's generated compose refers to its surroundings only through
`${APP_NET}`, `${DATA_ROOT}`, `${APP_DOMAIN}` … and **never** through a resolved
literal (see `envinject.Transform`). The literal is the bug: CasaDash used to bake
the network name and the host data path into each app's `docker-compose.yml` at
install time, which froze the app to the deployment it happened to be installed on.
Move the box, and every app was unstartable — with reinstall as the only way out.

Now the compose says *"whatever the app network is"*, `.env.app` says what it
currently is, and every start resolves the two afresh.

## Why the values are written into the app's `.env`

CasaDash could just pass them to `docker compose` in its own process environment —
it already runs the command. But then the app folder would only work when *CasaDash*
brought it up.

Writing them into the `.env` is the point: a `docker compose up -d` you run by hand
in `AppData/<app>/` must bring the app up **exactly** as CasaDash does. The folder
stands on its own. That is the promise of the app model (see
[`app-model.md`](./app-model.md)), and it is also what makes an app debuggable
without the dashboard in the loop.

## Adding a variable

Add a line to `.env.app`. That is the whole procedure — no rebuild, no code change.
It reaches every app on its next start.

## The default

```sh
APP_NET=mesh                 # the external network apps are attached to
APP_DOMAIN=                  # the deployment's base domain
APP_PUBLIC_IP=               # …and its public IP, in the spellings the store uses
APP_PUBLIC_IP_DASH=
APP_PUBLIC_IPV4=
APP_PUBLIC_IPV4_DASH=
APP_PUBLIC_IPV6=
APP_PUBLIC_IPV6_DASH=
domain=                      # lowercase alias: some x-compose-app webui-host use it
APP_EMAIL=
APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=casaos
DefaultUserName=admin
DefaultPassword=casaos
```

That default describes a standalone local install: apps on CasaDash's own `mesh`
network, no domain, so no reachable web address. A PCS overwrites it with
`APP_NET=pcs` and its real domain and IP; `dev/docker-compose.yml` does the same
through its `appenv` init container.

## A note on `REF_*`

CasaOS used `REF_SCHEME` / `REF_PORT` / `REF_DOMAIN` / `REF_SEPARATOR` to *synthesize*
an app's web-UI URL as `scheme://<app><sep><domain>:<port>` (`casa-img`,
`route/v2/appstore_pcs.go`). CasaDash replaced that mechanism entirely with
`x-compose-app`'s `webui-host` / `webui-scheme` / `webui-port` (see
[`x-compose-app.md`](./x-compose-app.md)), so those variables have no consumer here
and are gone. `REF_NET` and `REF_DOMAIN` were duplicates of `APP_NET` and
`APP_DOMAIN`, which a PCS already sets; they are gone too.

A `REF_*` line left over in an old app's `.env` is inert — nothing interpolates it —
and CasaDash leaves it alone rather than deleting a line it no longer owns.
